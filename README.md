# IndeedScraping
First web scrapper


For my first time scrapping a site, I selected one a site that is not appear friendly to scraping - or first time scrapers at least.
The robots.text file has a lot of "disallowed", and from where I sit the design of the jobs cards is meant to discourage scraping. 
The job titles and salarys both had elements that took me a little while to work around. In the end it was not so bad, and I actually found it 
to be a perfect place to really buckle down and figure parts out.

I still have issues getting all the data from each page but I feel this was a good point to stop for now. I want to impliment some of the lessons learned into a 
project I think will be more entertaining.
